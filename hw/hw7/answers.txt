For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified

Problem 3:

After commenting out 'seq = ""' and 'linenum = 0' I got the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 38, in <module>
    linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

The description of the NameError is pretty straight forward. Because linenum is no longer defined the program can't count what line it is on and therefore can't run the if statement that determines if the line it is on is one that contains dna data that needs to be processed.

The same error occured when the line containing 'gc_count = 0' was commented out. The GC content can't be counted because the starting point (0) hasn't been defined.
