Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

sample_1.fastq: GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
sample_2.fastq: GC-content: 0.45105133333333336
sample_3.fastq: GC-content: 0.6468641125240355
sample_4.fastq: GC-content: 0.3478523411663431
sample_5.fastq: GC-content: 0.2631578947368421
sample_6.fastq: GC-content: 0.4915185185185185

Problem 3:

After commenting out 'seq = ""' and 'linenum = 0' I got the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 38, in <module>
    linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

The description of the NameError is pretty straight forward. Because linenum is no longer defined the program can't count what line it is on and therefore can't run the if statement that determines if the line it is on is one that contains dna data that needs to be processed.

The same error occured when the line containing 'gc_count = 0' was commented out. The GC content can't be counted because the starting point (0) hasn't been defined.

Problem 4:

sample_1.fastq:
    GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
    AT-content: 0.5689938518518518

Problem 5:

sample_1.fastq:
    G-count: 5738773
    C-count: 5879128
    A-count: 7701287
    T-count: 7661547

Problem 6:

sample_1.fastq:
    Total Count: 27000000
    Sequence Length: 27000000
    Sum of GCAT: 26980735

sample_2.fastq:
    Total Count: 27000000
    Sequence Length: 27000000
    Sum of GCAT: 26977435

sample_3.fastq:
    Total Count: 9981008
    Sequence Length: 9981008
    Sum of GCAT: 9980961

sample_4.fastq:
    Total Count: 9981008
    Sequence Length: 9981008
    Sum of GCAT: 9980961

sample_5.fastq:
    Total Count: 76
    Sequence Length: 76
    Sum of GCAT: 75

sample_6.fastq:
    Total Count: 27000
    Sequence Length: 27000
    Sum of GCAT: 26990

test-high-gc-1.fastq:
    Total Count: 40000
    Sequence Length: 40000
    Sum of GCAT: 39840

test-high-gc-2.fastq:
    Total Count: 40000
    Sequence Length: 40000
    Sum of GCAT: 39841

test-moderate-gc-1.fastq:
    Total Count: 40000
    Sequence Length: 40000
    Sum of GCAT: 39841

test-moderate-gc-2.fastq:
    Total Count: 40000
    Sequence Length: 40000
    Sum of GCAT: 39811

In every .fastq file except for test-small.fastq the sum of the G, C, A and T count is less than the total count and sequence length. This is because within the sequence there are a handful characters that are not G, C, A or T.

Only the sum of GCAT quantity can be used in the denominator to compute the GC and AT content because the total count and sequence length include characters other than G, C, A or T in their count.

My program incorrectly computed the GC and AT content because of this. I will fix this now.
