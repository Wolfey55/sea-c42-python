# A little about me.

My name is Stephan Bosch. I am 27 years old and native to the Pacific Northwest.
I grew up on Orcas Island and moved to Olympia after completing high school to
attended South Puget Sound Community College for a degree in fire science. I spent
the next few years working as an EMT for a private ambulance company, volunteer
fire departments and contract firefighting for the DoD in places like Iraq and
Antarctica.

After completing my contracts I was feeling like I needed a change
in career so I went to the Diver's Institute here in Seattle to become a
commercial diver and I've been working for a marine construction company here
ever since. Commercial diving has been good but after doing it for the past few
years I can confidently say that it's not something I want to do for the rest of
my life so when I heard about Code Fellows, the skills you teach and job
placement guarantee I was immediately interested, so here I am...

## Some of my interests

I like to do a lot of active things like hiking, rock climbing, wakeboarding,
snowboarding and mountain biking...all the stereotypical Seattlite activities.
For a while now, I've also been interested in picking up wood working as a new
hobby. I got this dvd from [Bear Mountain Boats]
(http://www.bearmountainboats.com/) and one day, when I have the time, space and
money I hope to build my own canoe! test
